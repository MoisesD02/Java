Lab Practice: Objects, Methods, and Arrays in Java

This lab session provides a detailed analysis of objects in Java, which consist of fields (attributes) and executable units called methods, as well as one-dimensional arrays. The practice will be implemented using the Java programming language and will cover the following topics:

1 - Method declarations

2 - Argument promotion (overloading and type conversion)

3 - One-dimensional arrays (creation, manipulation, and traversal)
